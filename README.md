# Hoboken-Population-Distribution
This project was inspired by a joke my friend made - that resident age in Hoboken increases the farther you get from the Hoboken Train Station. I wanted to see if there was empirical evidence for this human intuition. It also provides a fun coding challenge that utilizes data mining, Pandas dataframes, visualizations, and (soon!) predictive modelling.
